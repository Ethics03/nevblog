        <p>A blog about CLI-Tools and the need of building more of them!</p>
<p>Full-Article Link:
<a href="https://medium.com/@honey032004/cli-tools-simple-fast-essential-66d0354d47b0">article link</a></p>
<p>We use CLI-Tools almost every day as developers, from git to docker.
These CLI-Tools are not just reliable but also efficient and user-friendly.</p>
<p>What is a CLI-Tool?</p>
<p>A CLI-tool is a piece of software that lets you interact with your operating system using text-based commands.</p>
<p>Some of the examples are :</p>
<ol>
<li>git</li>
<li>docker</li>
<li>npm</li>
<li>btop</li>
<li>distrobox</li>
</ol>
<p>But why really are they so powerful?</p>
<p>IDEOLOGY BEHIND CLI-Tools</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Portability</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether it’s from checking the tasks running on your operating system using btop or using the most famous example of CLI-Tool like git, CLI-tools are easy to use and really fast.</p>
<p>Now why or when do we really need a CLI-Tool?</p>
<p>Well, from a general perspective considering a large population of users of any operating system the general consensus is —</p>
<p>USE OF CLI IS A FUNDAMENTAL UX ISSUE</p>
<p>Well that is TRUE.</p>
<p>For basic tasks like file exploring, managing tasks making disk partitions etc. You really don’t need a CLI-Tool unless you messed up your OS install like me and really need it. Regardless for general users CLI-Tools are not preferred for day-to-day tasks or even some development tasks.</p>
<p>So who really needs CLI-Tools?</p>
<p>Before we talk about who really needs CLI-Tools let’s talk about some important issues it solves—</p>
<p>CLI Applications consume fewer network resources compared to graphical applications.
This is important for systems with limited hardware capabilities or remote server environment.</p>
<p>You can manage servers remotely by submitting commands over a secure shell.</p>
<p>FOR DEVELOPERS AND SYSADMINS
Learning CLI-tools and CLI-toolchain for Developers and Sysadmins helps in deeper understanding of the system.</p>
<p>For example: You want to quickly see logs for a particular error that you want to fix for your system?</p>
<p>A log is basically a file that records particular events for example system errors or crashes.</p>
<p>journalctl is a command-line utility in Linux used to view and query logs stored in the systemd journal.</p>
<p>This indeed is really fast and saves you a lot of time.</p>
<p>DEVELOPER’S BEST FRIEND
CLI-Tools are a developer’s best friend. They help you understand how each and every process of a particular software or service actually works and also helps you in understanding the general workflow of the code better.</p>
<p>git being the most popular CLI-Tool is really convenient and makes it way easy to pull repos, push commits and check status of your current dev-environment really fast and that saves a lot of time for the developer to actually code their project.</p>
<p>How does CLI WORK?
The CLI basically operates on the default shell. which is between the operating system and the user.</p>
<p>A shell is basically like a translator between you and the OS.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>when you open Terminal on Linux/macOS.</p>
<p>You want to search for a particular file in a directory?</p>
<img src = "/images/cli1.png"/>
<p><strong>Ah! found my config!</strong></p>
<p><strong>cd</strong> — command is basically used to move into a particular directory in this case (.config)</p>
<p><strong>ls</strong> — Is used to list all the files or folders in that particular directory.</p>
<p>So that’s how I got my config!!</p>
<p>That’s basically the shell that you’re using to find that file.</p>
<p>Now there is freedom to choose what shell you want to use depending on what features you need from that shell.</p>
<p>What I am using in the image above is fish shell.</p>
<p>Other popular options are :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bash</strong></li>
<li><strong>Zsh</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fish</strong></li>
<li><strong>Powershell</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a cool CLI-Tool called lazygit</p>

<p><em><strong>The power of CLI-Tools used at its best. It gives you are GUI-like experience for managing version control for your projects which even the pros love!!</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>WHY YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BUILDING YOUR OWN CLI-TOOL ?</strong></em></p>
<p>Now the main part of this article and the motivation it gives you is for making your own CLI-Tool and why you should make it?</p>
<p>GUI may not have the same flexibility as a command-line interface. GUIs do not support scripting and automation. Some things are easier done with one command than navigation through clicks.
CLI-Tools are loved by software developers and system administrators as it makes configuring, deploying, and maintaining systems easier and faster.
Example: package manager like npm or pip primarily support CLI.</p>
