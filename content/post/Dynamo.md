Just a cool project idea I had recently!
<!--more-->

So recently I got a new project idea.
I feel like it is already implemented but I want to give a catch to it.

I personally have a problem sitting for long hours when I'm working.

I like to give breaks to myself instead of solving a big problem for 2 hours straight up.

Well I had this project idea -> Named it Dynamo (because idk Dynamic Programming-like idea or something)

Platform - Put a big goal onto the platform.

- **AI - will make micro-goals of that particular goal. To achieve the bigger goal.**

- AI will make a new dashboard -
	 - **priorities** -> depending on the importance of the micro-goal.


- **Calendar** -> time your calendar ->  and Platform will send you reminder mails - Telling you have this micro-goal left for this day.

- **Tracking Progress** -> Progress Bar for each microprocess some of it increases. 
When its full -> bigger goal done.


- **MindMap (AI GENERATED) based on those microGoals** 

- Sources to learn or build it from.

 - **Divide microtasks as a Binary tree.**


-------------


**REWARD SYSTEM** 

- For each microtask done.
- For each microgoal done (added to profile)
- Badges depending on number of microgoals
- Streaks if done everyday continuously

Well this is basically a brief or a vague idea about the project. Will work on it lets see how it goes!
